# Stock Trainer

Have you been so desperate to find a simple stock trader? Well you've come to the right place!

Most of the code was copied from [this repo](https://github.com/scheng123/stock-algorithm-js-sandbox)

[Click here](https://scheng123.github.io/stock-trainer/) to access the published product.

To host the website, serve the files in the root project directory, like so:
```
# You can pick python, apache, or anything really
python3.7 http.server 8080 # Use python 3.7 as this version fixes the socket issue with chrome
```
The website's CSS making your eyeballs bleed? Open a pull request and comment how lazy I am on styling the website properly while sharing your awesome CSS!

Have fun!<br>
