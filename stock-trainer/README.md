# Stock Trainer

Have you been so desperate to find a simple stock trader? Well you've come to the right place!



To host the website, serve the files in the root project directory, like so:
```
# You can pick python, apache, or anything really
python3.7 http.server 8080 # Use python 3.7 as this version fixes the socket issue with chrome
```

Have fun!<br>
